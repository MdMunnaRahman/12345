          Helianthus is a genus comprising about 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower.Sunflowers are the most mood-boosting flowers to have in the garden! Why? Theyre brightly coloured, big, and attractive to all sorts of pollinators, bringing friendly critters to your garden and helping the environment. By planting sunflowers, youre helping yourself and helping the world and whats a better mood booster than that?

          Theres a fantastic long-flowering sunflower variety that Im talking about later in this post (for those who get a bit disappointed when their sunflowers eventually fade and die off), but before that Im going to talk about seven facts about these wonderfully cheerful plants!There are around 70 species of Helianthus (the Latin name for sunflower). Three are native to South America, and the rest are native to North America and Central America. However, the largest producers of sunflower seeds are Ukraine and Russia, who produce 15 and 13 million tonnes of seeds each year respectively!

          This means that both countries have stunning sunflower fields that stretch for acres. If youre ever in this area of the world, make sure you bring your camera.There are around 70 species of Helianthus (the Latin name for sunflower).
