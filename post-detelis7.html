          A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it
          bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. The flowers of most species
          have five petals, with the exception of Rosa omeiensis and Rosa sericea, which usually have only four. Each
          petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red.
          Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa omeiensis and Rosa sericea, four). These may
          be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded
          petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes.[5] Roses are insect-pollinated in
          nature.

          The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do
          not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The
          hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip
          comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded
          fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially
          the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest
          sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then
          disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.

          The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of
          the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose
          prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing
          over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles,
          probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand
          and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes).
          Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only
          vestigial prickles that have no points.
