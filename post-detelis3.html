          The flowering plant Delonix regia, which belongs to the Fabaceae family of beans, is distinguished by its fern-like leaves and vibrant flower display. It also goes by the name Krishna Chura. In many tropical areas of the world, it is grown as a decorative tree; in English, it is known as royal poinciana or flamboyant. The Krishna Chura tree may survive dry environment, although it prefers a tropical climate. It favors sandy, loamy, open, free-draining soil enriched with organic matter. The tree prefers a relatively moist environment and will not grow well in heavy or clay soils. 

          Seeds
          The most common method of propagating the Krishna Chura Tree is by seeds. After being gathered, seeds should be soaked in warm water for at least 24 hours before being planted in a nice, protected location and moist soil in a shaded area. The seeds can also be “nicked” or pinched and grown immediately in place of soaking. These techniques enable moisture to get through the hard exterior and promote germination. Under optimal circumstances, the seedlings increase and reach 30 cm (12 in) in aSemi-hardwood cutting propagation is less expected but as successful. Cut branches into 30 cm (12 in) parts made of this seasons or last seasons growth, then plant the sections in wet potting soil. This approach is chosen to guarantee that young trees can form even if it is slower than seed propagation. As a result, cuttings are a prevalent means of propagation for the more uncommon tree with yellow flowers. 

          Because it spreads extensively and grows to a modest height (most commonly 5 m or 15 ft, but it can reach a maximum height of 12 m or 40 ft), in addition to its ornamental value, it is a valuable shade tree in tropical environments. Its dense leaves provide complete shade. In regions with a distinct dry season, it loses its leaves during the dry spell, but in other areas, it is practically evergreen.You have to place a Krishna Chura tree where it will have adequate room to expand. This tree has a height limit of 40 feet and a spread of 40 to 60 feet. Even though the tree can offer a lot of shade, if it is not placed correctly, it could cause harm. 

          Additionally, because the Krishna Chura tree has weak roots and can easily cause damage, you should keep it away from buildings, pavement, and other areas where it might spread. If the fragile branches break or the seed pods fall to the ground, litter will result. By creating a wind-sheltered area and pruning the branches to create a sturdy branching structure, you can lessen the likelihood that the components will break.
