        <p>Hello, today I will like to talk about my dream job if I could say. My dream job is to become a computer programmer because I think its cool and meaningful and requires logic thinking. Not just that, but also to be able to help make the lives of people easily and simple. You might be wondering why Im saying this, as we all know, we are in the Computer Age and 90% of your daily activities requires the use of technologies. And we all know machines are here to stay and to make our lives easily.

          Who is computer programmer? This is a profession where you create instructions in the form of codes to the computer to be executed to enable software and applications program to function successfully.

          <br>
          Computers do amazing things but no computer can do anything on its own unless a computer programmer key in some codes and tells it to behave in a specific way. That is all what computer programming is about.

           Computer programming is the process programmers use to write codes that tells and instruct computers on how applications and software programs should operate.

           And guess what, Computer Programmers are one of the highest paid in their field and with this I think I can cater for basic and necessary needs of my family.
           <br>

           <br>
           To be a computer programmer, you must be creative and innovative so you can modify and design new applications and software programs. You also need to have a Degree in Bachelor of Computer Science or a Masters Degree to be able to be a Computer Programmer.

To be accepted into any University to read Computer Science after Senior High School, you will have to get credit passes in all your subjects of study (A1-C6) in your WASSCE. I met the requirements and I’m currently reading Bachelor of Computer Science. After I am done with my Bachelor of Computer Science and have gotten my Certificate, I’m planning on furthering into the Masters Degree so I can be well versed in Computer Programming.

Computer Programmers are rare in this part of the world and thus what’s keeping me going and I’m looking forward to learn something from steemit as well as make an impact.
