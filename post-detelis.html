          Especially the rhizomes, but also the other parts of N. nouchali (and other Nymphaea species), are considered astringent and tonic in South-East Asia, and a decoction is given for diarrhoea. In Vietnam, the rhizomes are also used for treating backache and stomach-ache, and in Cambodia for treating colic. In India, the powdered rhizome is prescribed as a demulcent for piles, and also for dysentery and dyspepsia. An infusion of the fresh rhizomes is considered emollient and diuretic, and used for blennorrhagia and infections of the urinary tract.

In the Philippines, the slightly bitter juice of the leaves and petioles is used for gonorrhoea. The juice possesses mildly narcotic properties, and is rubbed on the forehead and temples to produce sleep. In Cambodia, the juice from the leaves or the macerated leaves are an ingredient of a lotion applied to the skin for fever. In India and Thailand, the flowers are taken as a cardiotonic because of its astringent properties.

The rhizomes of N. nouchali are edible and rich in starch, like those of other Nymphaea species, though less appreciated than those of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertner (Nelumbonaceae, formerly in Nymphaeaceae). Seeds, young leaves and petioles of many other Nymphaea species are eaten as well. Nymphaea is often consumed as a famine food, but especially in Africa, it is part of the normal diet for certain tribes. The rhizomes are considered poisonous unless boiled.

In West Africa, the rhizome of N. lotus L. is sometimes chewed as a substitute for kola nut (Cola spp.). In India, the rhizomes of N. nouchali have been used for tanning purposes. Most Nymphaea species, including N. nouchali, are widely cultivated in the tropics as ornamentals.All parts of N. nouchali, except for the seeds, contain the alkaloid nymphaeine. This alkaloid is toxic to frogs and produces tetanus-like symptoms. Alcoholic extracts of the rhizome, containing the alkaloid, have a mild sedative and spasmolytic action. They do not significantly depress the heart; in large doses though, they have a paralysing effect on the medulla. Another alkaloid, coclaurine, was also found in the leaves and stem.

Nymphaea species contain several flavonoids e.g. kaempferols, quercetins and myricetins, especially in the flowers, and also a glycoside, nymphalin, which has a digitalis-like action.

The extract from the rhizomes did not cause a significant growth of mammary glands, when injected into immature female mice at 2 g/day for 5 days.

N. lotus contains the alkaloids nupharine, nymphaeine, nelombine and nupharidine, which are respiratory excitants. An overdose may cause death by lung poisoning, as has been seen in mice, dogs and fish. An extract of the leaves of N. pubescens Willd. was screened for its antifungal activity and caused 85% inhibition of spore germination in Fusarium solani, but not in Drechslera spicifera'.
